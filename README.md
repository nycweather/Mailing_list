# Mailing_list
In this project I built a webapp to record emails from potential customers. The frontend is supported through JavaScript and the backend uses mySQL server. So a client would put their email in our list and the email would be stored in mySQL server where we only take in two parameters: the email and when the request was created.  

Demonstration

From the loaded data we can use mySQL server to write queries in real time.

So we can generate tables as such.
